        Thank you for putting up with me for the past 8 months, I know i can be a bit hard on you, insensitive and stubborn at times.<br>

        I'm a bad communicator and prioritizes work over you more often than not.<br>

         Im not proud of that and its my goal this year to be a better listener to be more considerate and to treat you better than i have last year. <br>
         
        You have always been nothing but selfless to me, and devoted yourself to making sure that im content and never feel like im not loved or appreciated. <br>
           There is nothing i would <span class="text-red-500 font-bold">love</span> more than laying in your arms all day and accepting all of your your kisses albeit
          it has not come easy to me. The only way i've been able to show you my love before was working all night on projects trying to better myself so i
          can promise you a good and comfortable future with me, and even though it looked like I only cared about my my assigned project and programming it has always been for you,
           our future and our children.
           I know it don't seem like it at times but all the money and success would mean nothing without you by my side.

           <br>
           Love, Javaughn.
      </p>
